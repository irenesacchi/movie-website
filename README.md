“Movie Website” is an object-oriented Python application that will to generate a local HTML page with your favourite movies. 

# Prerequisites

In order for the application to run you’ll need Phyton installed on your computer. If you still do not have python installed, you must go on the Python download page and download version 2 (and not version 3 - as the application run on Python version 2)

Download the Movie Webiste zip-folder

Inside the folder you will find 3 files:
entertainment_center.py
fresh_tomatoes.py
media.py

# ==Running the application==

Open the entertainment_center.py by clicking twice on the file. 

You can already check the website with my preferences just Running the module (F5) or go to Run (upper menu bar) and click on Run Module. This action will generate a web HTML page with my favourites movies in it. You can also check the trailer clicking on the several poster-pictures. 

Inside the entertainment_center.py you can find the list of my favourite movies. 

If you want to create your own list, you’ll need to change the different Movie-Object with your own.

That’s it!

now you are ready to run the program again and see your favourites movies on the created HTML page. 

If you like to change the look of the page you should check the fresh_tomato.py file.
